---

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains booking information from a **city hotel** and a **resort hotel**, including:  
- 📅 Booking details (arrival dates, length of stay, room type, etc.)  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Customer demographics (adults, children, country of origin)  
- 💰 Financial aspects (deposit type, ADR – average daily rate)

- **Pandas** – data cleaning & preparation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualizations and trend analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – documentation and reproducibility

## 🔎 Analysis & Key Insights
The analysis highlights several important findings:  
- **City hotels** receive more bookings overall, while **resort hotels** have longer average stays.  
- **Cancellation rates are higher** for bookings made far in advance (long lead times).  
- Certain months (e.g., summer) show peaks in both **bookings and cancellations**.  
- **Repeat guests cancel less often**, showing the value of customer loyalty.  
- **Direct bookings** tend to have fewer cancellations compared to third-party channels.

## ✅ Recommendations
Based on the insights, hotels can take the following actions:  

- **Encourage repeat bookings through loyalty programs**  
  → Since repeat guests cancel less, offering rewards for returning customers can increase booking stability.  

- **Optimize cancellation policies for long lead-time reservations**  
  → Stricter policies or non-refundable discounts can reduce cancellations for early bookings.  

- **Adjust marketing and pricing strategies by season**  
  → During high-cancellation months, hotels can introduce flexible rescheduling, reminders, or promotions to secure customers.
